    "In part 3 we deal with a practical topic that's essential to research in complex networks: the techniques for doing experiments at the scale that's needed to get realiable computational results.  We'll address this mainly by talking about IPython's support for [parallel computing clusters](parallel.ipynb), but we'll go beyond the standard descriptions and look at how to [integrate a complicated and long-running computation](parallel-async.ipynb) into today's typical scientific workflows in which researchers typically use laptops: how can we do simulations on compute clusters without being tied to our desks while they happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then talk about the often-overlooked topic of *reproducibility*: how can we design, package, and publish experiments that others can replicate and build on? We'll look at the basics of [building predictable Python environments](reproducibility-python.ipynb), and then briefly talk about the use of [virtual machines and infrastructure-as-code](reproducibility-at-scale.ipynb) (also known as *devops*) as it applies to computational science to get reproducibility at scale."
