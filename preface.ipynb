They provide us with tools for understanding a huge range of real-world phenomena &ndash; phenomena that are resistant to other forms of analysis, but that can be studied, varied, experimented with, and explored using a combination of mathematical analysis and computer simulation.

Typically these are heavy on the mathematical aspects, and are illustrated by pretty pictures of complex networks of various types. What is left undescribed (perhaps because it's of less interest to the authors, perhaps because it's thought to be of less interest to the expected readers) is how to get from the maths to the pictures &ndash; and perhaps more importantly, how to explore real-world networks for which the mathematical descriptions may be lacking.\n",

      "As a computer science academic, I find this unsatisfactory in two distinct ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a technical level, the generation and processing of complex networks is anything but uninteresting to me: it's a fascinating application of computing techniques based on complex mathematical ideas. The better we understand these processes, and the easier we make them to express with computers, the easier it will be for other scientists to take these ideas and apply them to make new discoveries about the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any new technology &ndash; microscopes, telescopes, cloud chambers, particle accelerators &ndash; is about more than just a new piece of instrumentation. Each new tool doesn't just *help* with science: it *changes* it, and indeed the scientists who perform it. Each new tools requires new techniques, often developed by a new generation of scientists who can see the potential in a new way of thinking that's suggested or facilitated by the new kit. In this sense, I tend to think of the computer as the new microscope: computers change the way we do science, but also change the science that we do. If we can make computational techniques more accessible, we can deepen and accelerate these processes while discovering new things about computer science and information. \n",
      "\n",
      "At an academic level, most of my work takes place in conjunction with students. It's in the nature of modern science that most students (actually, most researchers of whatever seniority) have quite specialised backgrounds. One often encounters amazingly talented programmers; one often encounters individuals with profound mathematical understanding; but encountering someone who can understand the maths *and* the computing with equal facility is rare. Anyone coming to complex networks therefore has a problem: it's likely they'll have only part of the background they'll need, and the other part will be written in a language they don't understand &ndash; whether that's the language of statistical graph theory or the language of high-performance computing. That makes for a steep learning curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can identify personally with this. As a computer scientist, I have much more maths than average in my background &ndash; but significantly less maths than I need to do the work I currently want to do. Conversely, my ability to apply computer science to this work is hampered by unfamiliarity with some of the mathematical concepts needed to get fully to grips with it. This book arises out of my journey to fill in the gaps in my mathematical knowledge, and to deploy the things I *do* know a lot about &ndash; programming, distributed and high-performance computing &ndash; in order to explore complex real-world networks. Hopefully it's a journey that will be of interest to others in a similar position. "

      "The first thing to realise about this book is that, in its main form, it isn't actually a book at all. *Complex networks, complex processes* is built from a linked set of IPython notebooks, combining text, graphics, and live software. (Why Python? Because it's become the *lingua franca* of scientific computing, with a huge range of libraries and tools that take a lot of the drudgery out of programming and let you stay focused on the important, novel parts of your problems.) All the examples are built from code, and that code is included in the text: you can \"run\" the notebook to generate the images, graphics, and videos, or change the code to suit yourself. Alternatively, you can treat the code snippets as recipes you can copy into your own programs and applications. All the code needed to get the results discussed in the book, the simulations to create them and the diagrams to present them, is included within it; all the diagrams relating to networks are generated using Python, and all the code for them is included. The [software chapter](software.ipynb) contains pointers to everything you need to install to get things working.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as presenting how to compute with and simulate complex networks, *Complex networks, complex processes* also discusses their mathematics. We assume little in the way of mathematical background: apart from some elementary probability theory, matrix algebra, and calculus, the book aims to be mathematically self-contained, and we'll develop the maths we need as we go along. And just as all the code is backed by maths, so all the maths has code examples to show how it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's often tempting to stick close to what you know, for example taking the code snippets as you need them and ignoring the maths or the wider discussions. And that's fine if that's all you want. However, my experience has been that in order to work with these ideas, you need *both* the computing *and* the maths. Even though many real-world systems are too complex for analysis, you'll only know this if you understand the limits of the analysis that's possible; conversely, finding a network that's too complex to analyse won't defeat you if you're comfortable with simulation as well as analysis. The two approaches are really two sides of the same coin that complement each other: it's well worth taking the time to understand both."

We'll start by looking at [epidemic spreading](epidenic-spreading.ipynb), a common process that's used to model the spread of diseases and the spread of information. Again, we'll simulate the processes and then look at their mathematics. We'll then move onto to [percolation processes](percolation.ipynb), which are a more general and abstract process.\n",

      "At this stage, we'll have convered the basics of the field, and can move on to some more topical areas and their applications. We'll look at [modularity](modular-networks.ipynb) to show how even small changes in the way a network is put together can affect the behaviour of processes. Then we'll look at [multiplex or coupled networks](coupled-networks.ipynb) where we can specify and study the behaviour of a single process through multiple separate-but-interconnected networks. Finally we'll look at [adaptive networks](adaptive-networks.ipynb), in which the topology of a network (its static structure) changes in response to a process running dynamically over it. These are all questions of immediate interest to researchers working on models of real-world behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some special technical issues that also merit discussion. We'll look briefly at the tools and techniques needed to work with [very large networks](parallel.ipynb), which are needed when working at scale. We'll also look at [spatial data](geodata.ipynb), and specifically at getting data from map servers to display network behaviour and results more impactfully.\n",

      "But before any of that, we'll start with an insultingly brief history of the evolution of network science. You could treat this as a bluffer's guide to complex networks: all you'll ever need at a party to be instantly acclaimed as the resident network bore."

      "In the early 18th century the citizens of K&ouml;nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) had a problem. In the middle of their city, the River Pregel divided to form an island. The river was spanned by seven bridges connecting the island to the mainland parts of the city. The island and the river were popular venues for people to stroll, meet, and take the air &ndash; and to discuss whether it was possible to take a walk that crossed each bridge exactly once. In the manner of these things, the discussion grew into someting of a frenzy of speculation, with opinion dividing over whether it was impossible, or whether it was just that no-one had actually had the ingenuity to find a solution yet. Leonhard Euler, one of the best-known mathematicians of his (or indeed any other) time, visited K&ouml;nigsberg in 1735 and became aware of the problem. He solved it, in the process inventing what became known as *graph theory*."

      "Euler made two key observations. The first was that the actual *geography* of the problem was irrelevant: all that mattered was the *topology* of the problem, the ways in which the bridges linked the banks, since the essence of the problem was to find ways of connecting the ends of the bridges so that one could walk over all of them. Another way to look at this is that, after crossing one bridge, a walker is constrained in which bridges he can walk over next: those with an end on the bank or island on which he is now standing, and which he hasn't walked over already. In modern terminology represented each land mass as a *node* and each bridge as an *edge* connecting two nodes. It doesn't matter how big the land masses are, since a person may walk freely between any pair of bridges. The geographic problem has been converted into a problem of *networks* that can be studied in the abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euler's second observation was that, since people could move freely between all the bridges attached to a given land mass, the key to the problem was how many times a person's path intersected with each land mass. He reasoned that, since every bridge can be traversed only once, the only way to avoid being trapped is if each land mass has an even number of connections &ndash; so that if a person can enter, they can always leave. He realised that there are at most two exceptions to this rule, for the starting and finishing land masses, where it's possible simply to leave (or arrive) and therefore not need another link. Phrased in terms of the network, this converts the problem again from one of topology to one of *node degree*: it is possible to cross all bridges exactly once if the graph has zero or two nodes of odd degree, with all other being of even degree: otherwise one will get \"stuck\" in a node, unable to cross all the bridges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the map above, all the nodes &ndash; the left bank, right bank, island, and section of town on the right &ndash; all have odd degree, from which Euler concluded that there is no way for someone to traverse all the bridges without re-tracing their steps."

      "Euler's success led directly to modern network science, not simply because it allowed problems to be phrased in different ways, but because it suggested a *methodology* for solving problems: abstract them away from their details into the language of networks, and then use general mathematical tools to manipulate them. Once we have this abstract language, there are a number of properties of *networks in general* that may be of interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is the shortest path between two nodes? Or between *any* two nodes?\n",
      "1. Is it possible to trace a path from one node to another node in the graph? Or from a node to *every* node? How about from every node to *every other* node?\n",
      "1. Are there edges that, if we remove them, cause a node to become unreachable from another node?\n",
      "1. Of all the edges that *could* be present in the graph, how many actually *are* present?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first property is one of finding shortest paths; the second concerns whether the nodes are *reachable* and whether the network is *connected*; the third concerns the *robustness* of the network; the fourth the *density* of the network. The important point is that all these properties are *topological* or *graph-theoretic*: we don't need to know what the network represents in order to calculate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, all the properties say something about the phenomenon the network is modelling. In the case of the K&ouml;nigsberg bridges, for example, connectedness refers to whether, starting from any land mass, it is possible to reach any other land mass, while robustness concerns whether removing a bridge would be disasterous for travel. Any property we define at the network level may illuminate something at the problem level, and may even suggest things that we wouldn't have thought of simply by thinking about the problem alone. Or may not: it's not clear that density is especially relevant to bridge-building, since the problem is constrained by all sorts of physical factors that we've elided in moving to a network representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That highlights an important point about modelling. A model is an abstraction of a real problem, an abstraction necessarily leaves things out, and it's only by understanding the original problem and its real-world context that you can decide whether a particular thing left out is important or not: the network science won't tell you in and of itself."
