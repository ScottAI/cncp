This makes the simulation framework easier to use, but trickier to implement: the astute reader will have noticed that we didn't explain how `CompartmentedModel` works inside, and that's because it's a bit complicated. But it's also largely irrelevant in practice: you don't need to know how this particular piece of code works in order to use it for network science experiments.

    "The synchronous synamics we encoded above works by evaluating the process dynamics at each discrete timestep. This is an obvious approach, but one that begs two questions: how expensive is it to evaluate the dynamics at each step?; and, what proportion of timesteps do we evaluate the dynamics with no effect, because nothing changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the first question we can look at the `do()` method on `SynchronousDynamics`. At each timestep it retrieves all the places where an event might occur, which we know from our definition of SIR is any SI edge (for infection events) and any infected node (for removal events). For each place, it draws a random number and then possibly calls an event function. The amount of work therefore depends on the sizes of the two loci for events, which will presumably swell as the epidemic progresses: we might assume that in an average timestep about half the nodes are infected, and some smaller proportion of the edges are SI: we can't say much more without a lot more information about the structure of the network. The loci change as events occur, which means that `CompartmentedModel` will have to ensure that it can efficiently track these changes (and indeed a lot of the code complexity addresses exactly this).\n",

    "A slightly more significant problem is one of statistical exactness: the extent to which the simulation actually performs according to the probabilities. We won;t dig into this in too much detail, but the basic problem is simple to explain. In the `do()` method, for each possible event, we collect the possible places the event can happen and then decide whether the event actually happens there. There's a hidden assumption here that all these choices are independent of one another, but that's not quite the case. For example, if two infected nodes are connected to the same susceptible node &ndash; so there are two SI edges in the locus for infection events &ndash; then we have two chances to infect the susceptible node in the same timestep. If the first time happens to result in infection then the second one can't (by definition), making the actual rate of infections in a timestep varies just slightly from the expected value. Similarly, we may happen to run the removal events before the infection events, and so nodes infected in the timestep don'ty have any possibility of recovering in that same timestep &ndash; even if the probability of recovery were set very high.\n",

    "If these sound like trivial issues, well they may well be. But they may *not* be, depending on the exact combinations of parameters and network structures we encounter.

    "\n",
    "It might be that we're willing to accept these issues in the interests of simplicity: synchronous simulation is very easy to program and understand. But both the performance and the statistical exactness issues are caused by the same basic decision to use discrete time, and it turns out that we can address both by using a different simulation dynamics, one that works directly from the probability distributions in continuous time."
