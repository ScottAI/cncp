We allow a process to record the dynamical state of each node, as well as to record that a particular edge was traversed to transmit the infection. (This is known as the edge being *occupied*, notation derived from percolation theory that isn't very intuitive for epidemiology but nonetheless is the standard term.) We add helper methods allowing the network to be \"skeletonised\" to include only the occupied edges, which allows calculations to be performed on only the \"contact edges\" that actually transmitted infection, and to extract the sizes of the different sub-populations. We add a method to detect termination of the model &ndash; or, perhaps more accurately, to decide that it has reached steady-state, which by default we make happen after a \"long time\". Finally, we add abstract methods that can be used to set up, tear down, and express the dynamical process being simulated. These will be overridden in sub-classes to provide the two approaches we want to compare. "

It is therefore sufficient to run dynamics only at infected nodes, which are typically a small fraction of the nodes in the network at a given time. We therefore sub-class the `GraphWithSynchronousDynamics` class to provide SIR dynamics by overriding various methods. We define the set-up method to infect nodes with probability `pInfected`, and to mark all edges as unoccupied. We define a timestep of the dynamics to run the `model()` method on each infected node, with the model infecting adjacent susceptible nodes with probability `pInfect` (and marking the edge the disease traverses as occupied) before recovering with probability `pRecover`. We define equilibrium as either a \"long time\" or the infection dying out in the network. And we extend the `dynamics()` method to capture disease-level statistics to add to the simulation-level statistics captured by default. Specifically we capture the number, mean, and maximum sizes of outbreaks, which are defined as connected components within the skeletonised network representing only those nodes connected by occupied edges."

    "The synchronous synamics we encoded above works by evaluating the process dynamics at each discrete timestep. This is an obvious approach, but one that begs two questions: how expensive is it to evaluate the dynamics at each step?; and, what proportion of timesteps do we evaluate the dynamics with no effect, because nothing changes?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the first question, the `SIRSynchronousDynamics` class' `_dynamics_step()` method runs a stochastic process for each infected node in the networkat each timestep, whcih may result in adjacent susceptible nodes becoming infected, or in the infected node itself recovering, or both &ndash; or neither. Which of these three cases is probabilistic, and if the values of `pInfect` and `pRecover` are small (making a change of state unlikely) then in a lot of timesteps these calculations will leave the network's state unchanged. We can work out mathematically how likely this is to happen, but we can also observe it directly from the simulation, whcih is perhaps more useful. We collect two \"time\" numbers from each simulation run: the number of timesteps the simulation ran for (`timesteps`), and the number of timesteps in which events happened (`timesteps_with_events`). If the former is much bigger than the latter, this indicates that we executed a number of timesteps during which the state of the network didn't change: no susceptible node was infected, and no infected node recovered:"
