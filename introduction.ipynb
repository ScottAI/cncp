      "Complex networks are one of the most exciting developments to have happened in mathematical modelling and computer science in recent years. Network science provides us with tools for understanding a huge range of real-world phenomena &ndash; phenomena that are resistant to other forms of analysis, but that can be studied, varied, experimented with, and explored using a combination of mathematical analysis and computer simulation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You find conplex networks everywhere. To pick some areas largely at random, we find them in **biology** for the study of protein interaction networks to trace biochemical pathways; in **physics**, when exploring phase transitions in glasses and other materials; in **medicine**, where epidemiology increasingly uses complex networks to model real-world disease outbreaks; in **urban planning** to design city-wide transport infrastructures resistent to load and attacks; and in **digital humanities** to model the spread of information in social media. It probably goes without saying that they are also of intense interest for **mathematics** and for **computer science**, both in their own right and as vehicles to deploy advanced mathematical and computational techniques into other discplines. It's fair to say that almost no scientific field (and very few humanities fields) are unaffected by network science."

      "The first thing to realise about this book is that, in its main form, it isn't actually a book at all. *Complex networks, complex processes* is built from a linked set of IPython notebooks, combining text, graphics, and live software. (Why Python? Because it's become the *lingua franca* of scientific computing, with a huge range of libraries and tools that take a lot of the drudgery out of programming and let you stay focused on the important, novel parts of your problems.) All the examples are built from code, and that code is included in the text: you can \"run\" the notebook to generate the images, graphics, and videos, or change the code to suit yourself. Alternatively, you can treat the code snippets as recipes you can copy into your own programs and applications. All the code needed to get the results discussed in the book, the simulations to create them and the diagrams to present them, is included within it; all the diagrams relating to networks are generated using Python, and all the code for them is included. The [software resources chapter](software.ipynb) contains pointers to everything you need to install to get things working.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as presenting how to compute with and simulate complex networks, *Complex networks, complex processes* also discusses their mathematics. We assume little in the way of mathematical background: apart from some elementary probability theory, matrix algebra, and calculus, the book aims to be mathematically self-contained, and we'll develop the maths we need as we go along. And just as all the code is backed by maths, so all the maths has code examples to show how it works.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's often tempting to stick close to what you know, for example taking the code snippets as you need them and ignoring the maths or the wider discussions. And that's fine if that's all you want. However, my experience has been that in order to work with these ideas, you need *both* the computing *and* the maths. Even though many real-world systems are too complex for analysis, you'll only know this if you understand the limits of the analysis that's possible; conversely, finding a network that's too complex to analyse won't defeat you if you're comfortable with simulation as well as analysis. The two approaches are really two sides of the same coin that complement each other: it's well worth taking the time to understand both."

      "With this in mind, *Complex networks, complex processes* consists of discussions of the concepts and methods of network science interleaved with examples of how to perform these analyses in practice and at scale. The idea is to get a basic grounding in the issues and techniques; then show how you can apply them directly in code; and then explore more advanced ideas and implementation strategies. By then end of the book, you will hopefully be confident enough to build, simulate, and analyse complex networks in your own field &ndash; and do so using the methodlogies that are accepted as best practice and so can underpin the publication of your results as credible and robust. \n",

We'll then look at the simplest sort of complex process, [percolation](percolation.ipynb) over an ER network, and again use this to show how the complex network leads to results from the process that are perhaps a counter-intuitive.\n",

      "At this point we'll pause and look at how to [simulate](simulate.ipynb) complex processes over complex networks. This involves performing experiments repeatedly with different network instances and different parameters, to show how the results vary (or don't) as parameters change. This is a core issue of *repeatability* that's absolutely essential in science. In computational research, repeatability is complicated by the need for a stable software environment, and we'll look briefly at ways in which you can protect yourself against problems later.\n",

      "Like all scientific fields, network science is a product of a particular history. It didn't spring fully-formed into how we encounter it today, but rather evolved through a process of application, accident, and insight. *Application* because networks arose as a way of solving particular problems that were troubling people; *accident* because these problems, the order in which they were encountered, and the tools with which they were addressed were at least somewhat accidental and dependent on the individuals concerned; and *insight* because the major advances came about through unexpected intuitive leaps of imagination that went beyond simply solving a problem at hand. When people say that science proceeds steadily and logically, it's as well to remember that all scientific theories have histories that guided (and in many cases impeded) their development."

      "In the early 18th century the citizens of K&ouml;nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) had a problem. In the middle of their city, the River Pregel divided to form an island. The river was spanned by seven bridges connecting the island to the mainland parts of the city. The island and the river were popular venues for people to stroll, meet, and take the air &ndash; and to discuss whether it was possible to take a walk that crossed each bridge exactly once. In the manner of these things, the discussion grew into someting of a frenzy of speculation, with opinion dividing over whether it was impossible, or whether it was just that no-one had actually had the ingenuity to find a solution yet. Leonhard Euler, one of the best-known mathematicians of his (or indeed any other) time, visited K&ouml;nigsberg in 1735 and became aware of the problem. He solved it, in the process inventing what became known as *graph theory*."

      "Euler made two key observations. The first was that the actual *geography* of the problem was irrelevant: all that mattered was the *topology* of the problem, the ways in which the bridges linked the banks, since the essence of the problem was to find ways of connecting the ends of the bridges so that one could walk over all of them. Another way to look at this is that, after crossing one bridge, a walker is constrained in which bridges he can walk over next: those with an end on the bank or island on which he is now standing, and which he hasn't walked over already. In modern terminology represented each land mass as a *node* and each bridge as an *edge* connecting two nodes. It doesn't matter how big the land masses are, since a person may walk freely between any pair of bridges. The geographic problem has been converted into a problem of *networks* that can be studied in the abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euler's second observation was that, since people could move freely between all the bridges attached to a given land mass, the key to the problem was how many times a person's path intersected with each land mass. He reasoned that, since every bridge can be traversed only once, the only way to avoid being trapped is if each land mass has an even number of connections &ndash; so that if a person can enter, they can always leave. He realised that there are at most two exceptions to this rule, for the starting and finishing land masses, where it's possible simply to leave (or arrive) and therefore not need another link. Phrased in terms of the network, this converts the problem again from one of topology to one of *node degree*: it is possible to cross all bridges exactly once if the graph has zero or two nodes of odd degree, with all other being of even degree: otherwise one will get \"stuck\" in a node, unable to cross all the bridges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the map above, all the nodes &ndash; the left bank, right bank, island, and section of town on the right &ndash; all have odd degree, from which Euler concluded that there is no way for someone to traverse all the bridges without re-tracing their steps."

      "Euler's success led directly to modern network science, not simply because it allowed problems to be phrased in different ways, but because it suggested a *methodology* for solving problems: abstract them away from their details into the language of networks, and then use general mathematical tools to manipulate them. Once we have this abstract language, there are a number of properties of *networks in general* that may be of interest:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is the shortest path between two nodes? Or between *any* two nodes?\n",
      "1. Is it possible to trace a path from one node to another node in the graph? Or from a node to *every* node? How about from every node to *every other* node?\n",
      "1. Are there edges that, if we remove them, cause a node to become unreachable from another node?\n",
      "1. Of all the edges that *could* be present in the graph, how many actually *are* present?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first property is one of finding shortest paths; the second concerns whether the nodes are *reachable* and whether the network is *connected*; the third concerns the *robustness* of the network; the fourth the *density* of the network. The important point is that all these properties are *topological* or *graph-theoretic*: we don't need to know what the network represents in order to calculate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, all the properties say something about the phenomenon the network is modelling. In the case of the K&ouml;nigsberg bridges, for example, connectedness refers to whether, starting from any land mass, it is possible to reach any other land mass, while robustness concerns whether removing a bridge would be disasterous for travel. Any property we define at the network level may illuminate something at the problem level, and may even suggest things that we wouldn't have thought of simply by thinking about the problem alone. Or may not: it's not clear that density is especially relevant to bridge-building, since the problem is constrained by all sorts of physical factors that we've elided in moving to a network representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "That highlights an important point about modelling. A model is an abstraction of a real problem, an abstraction necessarily leaves things out, and it's only by understanding the original problem and its real-world context that you can decide whether a particular thing left out is important or not: the network science won't tell you in and of itself."

Eventually, however, researchers realised that ER networks do ot model *all* phenomena. Specifically, they do not model networks with \"clumpy\" degree distributions, as are often found in the engineered and natural systems. The canonical example is the World Wide Web, which in network terms might be modelled by nodes representing pages and edges representing hyperlinks between them. (The web is actually a *directed* network: we'll ignore this subtlety for now.) Web pages have a *very* clumpy degree distribution. Most pages have very small numbers of links to them, while some have huge degree (for example popular books on Amazon)."
