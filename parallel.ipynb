      "So far so good: we've looked at a simple kind of complex network, and a simple kind of complex process. We've shown how we can analyse them analytically and simulate them, using the interactive capabilities of IPython to control computations, gather the results, produce graphs, and then make the whole lot available on the web.\n",

      "If you've taken the opportunity to look at any of the research papers mentioned in the text so far, however, you may have noticed something that makes you slightly uncomfortable. Simulations need to be run several times for different parameter values to even-out the stochastic nature of the network/process interactions. Complex network effects often only work on large networks: in theory as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, in practice with \"lots\" of nodes and edges. Both these factors combine to generate a *lot* of computation: 10000 simulation repetitions across a space of two parameters over networks of 100000 nodes would not be especially unusual. Performing a simulation like tis on a typical desktop workstation or laptop is clearly not going to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been a persistent story in computer science, of course, and it's usually tackled by appealing to [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), the notion that the amount of computing power available at a given price  doubles roughly every eighteen months. However, the programs we commonly write are sequential, and the Moore's law curve is flattening out for individual processor cores, reducing the speed-up available to sequential programs over time. Extra speed-up comes, not from faster processor cores, but from having more cores available, often on the same processor: but taking advantage of this means *parallel* processing with multiple\"threads\" of activity happening simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "To do research-grade simulation of complex networks and complex processes, then, requires that we tackle high-performance parallel computing. While the general techniques of parallel programming are quite arcane, there are specific techniques that are easy to use both conceptually and (to some extent) technically &ndash; and fortunately much of network science simulation fits into these special cases. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter we explore the approaches we need to work with large networks. We start with the concepts of parallel systems as far as we need to understand them for our purposes. We'll then talk about using IPython's parallel tools, which turn out to be well-suited to the sorts of computations we want to perform, and which mean we can utilise high-performance computing from within the same interactive environment we've been using up to now. We'll look at two separate approaches to getting parallel processing: clusters (both local and remote), and cloud computing. In between we'll re-visit the issues of reproducibility that we explored [earlier](simulate.ipynb#sec_repeatability_small), since these are becoming increasingly important to conducting science at scale.

It surprises some people that this isn't true of all programs, but a typical program is *sequential* and executes a single \"thread\" of instructions. If a computer looks like it's doing several things simultaneously, it's just because it's splitting its time between multiple (sequential) tasks very quickly. *Real* parallelism, which is the only way to leverage the power of more than one core for solvoing a single task or problem, requires that we think differently about programming.\n",

The confidence part matters: without a level of confidence in the programming, one can have little confidence in the predictions being made, and run the risk that the whole analysis will be flawed and misleading. It's therefore far preferable to stick to the well-understood patterns wherever possible.\n",

      "What we're instructing the machine to do here is to process the data structure (an array in this case) one element at a time. This of course is what machines do at their lowest level, accessing data from memory and applying instructions to it. It's an easy, straightforward, and above all easily-comprehensible way to describe an algorithm that's taught to all programmers from when they first start programming. But it's not the only way to express computation.\n",

      "This \"reductionist\" style of programming is sometimes referred to as the *von Neumann style*. [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) was another giant in the history of mathematics and computing, and his design for computers &ndash; the *von Neumann architecture* consisting a single central processing unit connected to memory, disc, and other peripherals &ndash; has influenced all the computers ever built. Although modern machines don't strictly follow von Neumann's design in at the hardware level, they typically take great pains to *behave* as though they do, and it's the mental model model programmers typically have of the way their computer is organised. The problem is that this forces algorithms to run sequentially because that'd how they're explicitly written. This limitation has been called the *von Neumann bottleneck* &ndash; although that's unfair to von Neumann, who intended his architecture as a reference model rather than a design approach that would persist for sixty-odd years.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another style of programming, however, that focuses on describing how a program deals with data structures as a whole. Rather than write loops that traverse arrays one element at a time, for example, this style provides functions that (for example) apply the *same* operation to *all* elements of the array in one go, or to reduce all the elements through repeated application of some binary operator. The programmer writes her program to manipulate the entire array in one go, using the \"bulk\" operators. Internally the bulk operations might be written as loops, as in the von Neumann style, but &ndash; critically &ndash; they might be written to work in parallel. Algorithms written in this style therefore aren't *inherently* sequential (although they might be realised that way): they have the *opportunity* for parallelism.\n",
      "\n",
      "(This style is often associated with functional programming, but that's misleading. Functional programming is concerned with lack of side effects, amongst other concerns, which do make the \"bulk\" style easier to work with, but aren't necessary for it. It's perfectly possibly apply bulk operations in traditional or object-oriented languages with side effects. There are plenty of reasons to adopt functional languages and a functional style, but parallelism isn't really a very good one: you can get the same benefits in a sufficiently rich imperative language, and keep access to a better range of libraries.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Building an algorithm that can be parallelised is therefore different to writing a sequential algorithm. Often it's easier if one thinks at a larger scale &ndash; in terms of entire vectors or arrays, rather than their elements &ndash; and code-up the algorithm using appropriate bulk operators. Many of these operators can, it turns out, be effectively parallelised, and once that's happened, *all* programs that use them can gain from parallelism: the programs essentially transition from the \"impossible\" the the \"trivial\" category through clever coding of a small set of operators that work for an entire class of programs, rather than through clever coding of a single program. This is a much more productive use of programmer talent and time."

Typically we have a number of machines being used for computing, and we'll refer to these machines as a *cluster*. Within the cluster most of the machines are usually dedicated to providing compute services, and we refer to these as *workers*. There is a single machine that doesn't provide computing but instead manages the compute services providee by the others, and we'll refer to this machine as the *cluster head*. Outside the cluster there will be one or more *client* machines being used by scientists, which may be deaktop or laptop machines, and may be powerful in their own right.\n",

Each client will have one or more IPython processes to manage the interface with the users, and we'll refer to these processes generically as *notebooks* even though they might actually be just scripts. On the cluster head there is a single *controller* that acts as the gateway to the cluster's compute resources. On the cluster workers there are a number of *engines* that connect to the controller. How many engines? There can be as many as you want on each worker, but modern servers are becoming increasingly multicore and typically one would start as many engines as the worker has cores.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Some things don't travel.** This is actually quite a subtle issue. The IPython engines are separate processes from the client. If we run a function in an engine, then the function and all its data have to be passed from the client, over the network, to the engine &ndash; even if both are on the same machine. This is accomplished by pickling the data in the same way as you'd pickle data to store it on disc.\n",

      "Not all types pickle, however: notably, the standard pickler can't pickle function closures. We can get around this by using a better pickler like `dill`, but there are still some types that can't be transported. Often they're buried deep in libraries: for example, you can't send a `scipy` random variable from a notebook to an engine. This means that idioms you might use on a single machine can be problematic in a parallel scenario. You can minimse the problems caused by distribution by sticking with simple data types that `dill` (at least) can handle: classes, function closures, basic types, lists and dictionaries of these types, most elements of `numpy`.\n",

      "**Separate the simulation logic from the setup logic.** When writing a simulation, write the actual network implementation to be as clean as possible. That's the simulation logic. When it comes to setting-up and and running the simulations, have another function that sets-up the simulations, possibly on an engine. This is the setup logic, and it is the place to deal with the nastiness caused by distribution.\n",

When the controller starts, it generates a key file (plus some other metadata) and stores it as `.ipython/profile_cluster/security/ipcontroller-client.json`. We copy this file from the cluster head to the client, placing it into the client-side profile directory at the same location. We therefore have two machines &ndash; client and cluster head &ndash; with potentially slightly different IPython profiles but each with a copy of the key file that the controller created.

However, if you edit the cluster's configuration for any reason, you'll need to remove the key files, let the controller create new ones, and then copy these down to the client.

Sending lots of data can slow things down substantially, especially as an engine that's exchanging data isn't doing useful computation.

The load-balanced view will take  and apply it in parallel to the first 128 elements of the range, computing `f(0)`, `f(1)`, and so on up to `f(127)`. These calculations might take radically different amounts of time. When an engine finishes and returns a result, the view gives it the next calculation &ndash; `f(128)` in this case &ndash; to do, and similarly as other engines complete. This all happens transparently of the programmer, so as far as you're concerned you map `f` over the list and get speed-up from parallel execution.\n",

In some cases jobs all take roughly the same time; in others jobs make radically different computational demands. The ideal is where every engine is kept 100% busy and they all finish their final job at roughly the same time; in reality, we can keep the engines busy until the last jobs ahave been submitted to an engine, and work will trail off as these jobs are finished and no new ones are allocated.\n",

Then we map the process function across the networks using a load-balanced view.

      "Let's deal with the problems first, starting with the client's memory, and then move to some possible solutions. To run the simulations for a given pair of parameters, we have to build 10000 instances of a 100000-node network. That's going to use a considerable amount of memory, since it's $10^9$ nodes with their associated edges. A slightly different programming approach, and we'd store all the networks for *all* the parameter combinations: $10^{11}$ nodes, with edges. That's a *lot* of storage.\n",

The controller has to acquire and store the data, and then retain it until it can be passed to an engine. Both of these require communicating a 100000-node network between two machines. That's a *lot* of data movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this is happening the client, controller, and engines all have to maintain and exchange information in the background to keep things working. We have to keep the work flowing, possibly monitoring when jobs complete and sending a new job to the now-free engine. Finally, we have to return whatever metrics we derive at the end of the simulation back to the client for processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can argue about whether this partcular scenario would work on a particular hardware set-up, and the notion of something being \"too big\" will change over time, but I think it's safe to say that we have too much of a good thing here: too many jobs, too much network traffic, too much overhead, too much memory being used in one place. Each of these \"too much\"es is a recipe for a failure that stops things working and loses data.\n",
      "\n",
      "But didn't we do everything right? Yes and no. Conceptually we did indeed do the right thing. We split up our initial problem into a load of independent computations that could be performed in parallel and then aggregated. But we then simply implemented that solution na&iuml;vely, without considering the reality of the situation. We were on the right track, however: having the right conceptual framework is half-way to a solution, what we need to do is realise this framework in a more realistic manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two techniques we can use to improve our implementation. Firstly, we can think about *where computation occurs*, and specifically about where we build the networks we're going to use: do they *have* to be passed between machines, or can we build them where they'll be used? Secondly, we can \"chunk\" jobs together and schedule a smaller number of larger jobs: still enough to keep the engines busy, but not enough to cause problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's use these two techniques in our scenario. Conceptually we have a simulation function and a network it runs over. We could have the simulation function build the network itself and then work on it. That sounds equivalent, and indeed it is, at one level: that's really the point. But implementationally, in the first case we created functions and networks at the client and then communicated them to an engine *via* the controller; in the second case we created functions at the client and communicated them, and they then built their own network locally at the engine: no communication needed. We've immediately reduced the client's memory requirement and the amount of data communicated &ndash; and, incidentally, speeded things up by allowing non-trivial task of creating the large networks to happen in parallel at the engines that will then use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've still got a lot of jobs. Currently our simulation function performs a single simulation. We could re-code it to perform all 10000 repetitions for a given pair of parameters, building a new random network locally for each repetition. Now instead of $10^6$ jobs (10000 repetitions each of 100 parameter pairs), we have 100 jobs each of which performs 10000 repetitions. Moreover, since the reason we're doing the repetitions is probably to compute average values for the various metrics, we could do *that* computation at the engine too and just ship back the average values, rather than the values for each repetition (since we don't care about them). Again, we've reduced communications, *and* speeded things up by performing parallel calculations, *and* saved computation at the client since the code returns averages not raw data needing further processing. \n",
      "\n",
      "But we need to pause a moment: 100 jobs does not sound like very many. If we had a cluster with 128 engines &ndash; not unreasonable at the time of writing &ndash; then we only have enough work for 100 of them: we leave around 20% of the engines idle. On the other hand, if we only have 64 engines, we can keep them all busy for longer. If we had 128 engines, maybe we'd want to build smaller chunks &ndash; two jobs doing 5000 repetitions each for each parameter pair, perhaps? &ndash; to give ourselves 200 jobs to spread across the available machines. Alternatively we could increase the number of parameters, maybe explore $a$ and $b$ over 20 points each, yielding 400 jobs each of 10000 repetitions. (If that sounds a bit gratuitous, in reality we often let problems expand to fill the computers we have available: a sort of computational version of [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's recapitulate the journey we've just made. We started with a scientific problem to solve. We build a conceptual model that divided-up the problem into lots of independent jobs to solve independently and then combine together. We then tweaked this model to make it realistic, taking account of the limitations of real computers and their interconnects, and arrived at a model that is tailored to fit actual computational environment we have available. We can now code this up and run it. It's important to note that the steps we've taken haven't really tied us down too much: we'd need to re-code the simulation slightly and provide appropriate values for the number of repetitions and the like, but fundamentally the final code is very much like our initial formulation. Later we'll see how to do this in practice.  "

      "So asynchronous operation means that we submit jobs to a controller and then disconnect, returning later to collect the results. This implies that the controller we connect to remembers the results of calculations until we come back for them. Moreover, re-connection means that, from the controller's perspective, a *new* client is asking for the results of a *different* client's computations. \n",
      "\n",
      "The default set-up for a controller is a little too simple for this approach: it assumes that a client asks for its own results, and forgets uncollected results when clients disconnect. To enable the behaviour we need, we need to  set things up so that the controller remembers results. As a side benefit, this also makes the controller more robust to engine failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed above how each IPython compute job is bound to a message with a message identifier. The tweak we'll make to the controller's set-up is to have it store the message ids and their results in a database that persists over time. This means that a client can request the result of a specific message and retrieve it from the database (if it's been computed yet), wait for it (if it hasn't), or query whether it's ready or not and come back later.\n",
      "\n",
      "IPython can use a number of different databases to manage its message store. The simplest is to use SQLite, support for which is built-in to Python. You can also use MondoDB or other database providers for special circumstances, but the purposes of this book we'll stick to SQLite as it's proved robust and scalable enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "Making use of SQLite as message store involves changing a single configuration parameter. We again edit `.ipython/profile_cluster/ipcontroller.py` (assuming our profile is called *cluster*) and make a single edit:\n",

      "\n",
      "Starting the cluster will then create a database called `/ipython/profile_cluster/task.db` that will be populated with incoming messages and their computed results."

Calling `ready()` on this object tests whether the job's result is ready or not, so we end up with a list of ready values, `True` for jobs that have completed and `False` for those that are still on-going.

      "It's important to note two things at this point. Firstly, we can disconnect the client completely from the cluster. Since some simulations might take a wekk, this is clearly a useful thing to be able to do (especially if you're a laptop-user). Secondly, to get this functionality, we've changed the set-up of the cluster and added some client code, but we haven't changed the simulation code at all: asynchronous operation in IPython is purely about how you *call* code, not about the *called* code at all. This isn't true of other computing frameworks, and is quite a benefit: it means that IPython simulations scale-out much more easily, since you can run them small and debug them locally and synchronously before running them asynchronously for the real task.
