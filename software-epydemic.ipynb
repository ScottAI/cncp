    "Having developed a [discrete compartmented model of disease](epidemic-network.ipynb#sec_epidemic_network_discrete_process), we now have to turn it into code. Most epidemic processes share a common form and can be simulated using a small set of common techniques. It therefore makes sense to capture the form of an epidemic process in code, and then use that code to drive a simulator. In this way we can focus on the epidemic process rather than on the process of simulation.\n",

    "We make use of a Python library, `epydemic`, written to provide a framework within which to conduct simulations of epidemic processes. `epydemic` provides three main elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A base class for describing epidemic processes quickly and cleanly;\n",
    "1. A small library of common epidemic processes that can be used as a starting point for defining additional processes; and\n",
    "1. Implementations of the two most common simulation regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as providing the small-scale features we introduce in this chapter, `epydemic` has features for performing large-scale simulations on paralle compute clusters, integrating cleanly with the [`epyc`](software-epyc.ipynb) simulation library. We'll discuss this intregration in more detail later. You can also read the [API documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/epydemic/) for a full description of `epydemic` and its capabilities."

    "An instance of a sub-class of `epydemic.CompartmentedModel` basically encodes exactly the kind of discrete model we [developed earlier](epidemic-network.ipynb). Each node in the network resides in a **compartment**, a box representing the [disease state](epidemic-compartmented.ipynb) of the node. We are typically interested in how the sizes of the compartments change over time. A **locus** is a place in the network where an **event** can occur, where an event typically changes the compartment of one or more nodes around the locus. [An example event in SIR](epidemic-networtk.ipynb#sec_epidemic_network_discrete_process) would be an infection event, whose locus is the set of SI edges and which causes the S end to become I and any edges to adjacent S nodes to be classified as SI (i.e., be added to the locus for possible future infection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of loci is that `epydemic` keeps track of the nodes and edges in each locus at each stage of the simulation. In our SIR example, after every simulation event `epydemic` checks whether any nodes should be removed from the infected locus and whether any edges should be added to the SI locus &ndash; and does so automatically in a way that is optimised to only check as little of the network as necessary. This both makes simulation more efficient and simplifies the epidemic process description. "

    "Let's look at the `build()` method first. This is called to construct the epidemic model. It first extracts the three parameters for the simulation from the hash of parameters.

(There are no initially-removed nodes.)\n",

Loci come in two flavours in `epydemic`. **Node loci** capture nodes in a given compartment, while **edge loci** are edges linking nodes in two particular compartments. In this case, we have a node locus for infected nodes and an edge locus for SI edges (which we name for later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we bind events to each locus using `addEvent()`. Events happen at a given locus with a given probability. An event is a function that takes four parameter: the simulation dynamics, the current simulation time, the `networkx` network, and an element from the locus to which the event is bound (either a node or an edge). Since we represent events by methods on the model object, we need to wrap them in lambda expressions (Python closures) so that, when the event is triggered, it calls the correct method on the right model. We then bind these events to the correct loci. A locus may have several events associatd with it if desired, and conversely the same event might occur at several loci. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above code completely specifies the structure of the epidemic. We now need to specify what happens at each event. For a `remove()` event, we are passed a node and change its compartment using `changeCompartment()`. For an `infect()` event we are passed an SI edge, with the edge being aligned so that the compartments of its endpoints match the way we specified in defining the corresponding locus. We change the susceptible end's compartment to be infected, and mark the edge itself as \"occupied\", since the infection spread along it."
