    "In this final part we draw together some of the tooling aspects that we've referred to throughout the rest of *Complex networks, complex processes*. These include the use of a [standard virtual environment](software-venv.ipynb) for all our simulations, to facilitate reprodicibility; and the use of a framework for [managing large numbers of experiments and repetitions](software-epyc.ipynb) within this environment, to facilitate good working practices. We'll also point to the [various Python libaries](software.ipynb) and tools we've made use of."
