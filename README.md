Complex networks, complex processes
===================================

This is the source repository for my book "Complex networks,
complex proceses". As the title suggests, it is about the construction
and analysis of complex networks and the processes that run over
them. It is intended to sit on the boundary between mathematics and
computer science and to help get new researchers up to speed with the
ideas and technologies.

If you just want to read the book, it can be found here:

At present the book is very much a work in progress, but I'd be
delighted to receive any comments from anyone who's interested in
these areas and ideas.
