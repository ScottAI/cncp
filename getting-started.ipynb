And if you're reading this at all, we'll assume that you're already a programmer to some degree, in some programming language or other &ndash; and to be quite frank, if this describes you, then you can learn in a weekend all the Python you'll need to at least follow the code we develop in this book. It really is that simple as a programming language!"

    "Firstly, you need to make sure you've got the Python packages you need. As a general rule, a modern Python installation (as found in, for example, a modern Linux distro) will have a lot of the packages needed for scientific computing already installed. These are sometimes referred to as \"the `SciPy` stack\". If your installation doesn't have these, then look at the [installation instructions](http://www.scipy.org/install.html) and install the packages by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a couple of packages that aren't included in the `SciPy` stack. Chief amongst these is [`NetworkX`](http://networkx.github.io/), a library for creating and manipulating networks. You can do this using `pip` from the command line:\n",

    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "pip install seaborn\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, later chapters make use of [`epyc`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/epyc), a library for managing large suites of computational experiments such as are generated by simulating complex processes within a serious research project. `epyc` works very well with *Complex networks, complex processes*, not least because it was written precisely to support the sorts of experiments we describe here.\n",

    "<pre>\n",
    "pip install epyc\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",

There's a chapter that details [all the Python packages we use](software.ipynb) and explains what they do, including those in the `SciPy` stack and some additional ones that might be useful but aren't really essential."

There's a [whole chapter](software-venv.ipynb) devoted to explaining how to set up a \"standard\" virtual environment that's pretty much guaranteed to be able to run all the code in this book. "
