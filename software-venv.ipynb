    "It's an unfortunate fact of life that the results of computational experiments are often subject to the vagaries of software versions. A calculation that works fine in one environment may fail in another &ndash; or, worse, may successfully calculate the wrong results. The reasons for this are many and varied, but are the bane of the existence of many computational scientists.\n",
