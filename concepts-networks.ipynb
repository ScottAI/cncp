    "A **network** consists of a collection of **nodes** (also known as **vertices**), which are connected to each other by a collection of **edges**. Each edge connects two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically a network is actually a representation of something else, where the network extracts and simplifies the description of a cmore complex real \"thing\". Examples of networks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A road network. Nodes represent junctions, while edges represent streets that connect junctions (nodes) together.\n",
    "* A social network. Here nodes represent people, with edges representing relationships between them such as friendship, parentage, and so forth.\n",
    "* A protein interaction network. These are used to model the biology of cells. A node represents a protein, and an edge represents the fact that two proteins interact in some way within the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things are immediately apparent from these examples. Firstly, networks are a very general idea that can apply to an awful lot of phenomena. Secondly, the simple description we used may be inadequate for some systems, anmd we may need to introduce more structure. For example we might want the edges in a social network to be **labelled** with what kind of relationship they represent: friends, colleagues, family, and so on. (But it's interesting to note here that [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) doesn't do this, and treats everyone as a \"friend\": it only has one kind of edge. Sometimes simplicity can work best.) We might also want to label nodes, for example with a name or other identifier. We might want edges to be **directed**, for example to indicate that someone is the parent of someone else and not *vice versa*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, networks come in all sorts of sizes. Biological networks are often overwhelmingly large because of the myriad elements and interactions that make up biological systems. We usually refer to the size of a network as its **order**, being simply the number of nodes it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we might observe that networks might have very different patterns of connectivity. Two nodes that are connected by an edge are said to be **adjacent**. A node might be adjacent to a lot of other nodes (that is, have a lot of edges that connect it to other ndoes), while others may be adjacent to very few. In the social network case these differences might correspond to people with lots of friends *versus* people who are more solitary (or isolated). Things might get even more complicated, if we consider that people who are very popular often have proportionately more friends who are themselves very popular. All these features are issues of the **topology** of a network, and topology turns out to be one of the most interesting and powerful features of complex networks.  "

It's especially confusing in this context, as we'll frequently be drawing this second kind of graph when exploring the properties of networks &ndash; the *other* kind of graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason we'll try to use the term \"network\" for the node-and-edge structure, and keep \"graph\" for the line-and-error-bar structure. It's important to bear in mind, though, that terms like \"network\" and \"graph\" as well as \"network science\" and \"graph theory\", can be used somewhat interchangeably."

It's a very complicated piece of software with a lot of fascinating and useful features that we'll introduce and explore as we go along. For the moment, though, we'll start with the really basic functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as `networkx`, we need some other packages. `numpy` is the Python standard mathematical library that provides a host of functions and capabilities that find application everfywhere in network science. To help visualise the networks we build we use `matplotlib`, which is the standard Python package for drawing scientific diagrams. Again, it's a frighteningly useful piece of kit that we'll gradually exercise more and more. We'll also make use of `seaborn`, which modifies `matplotlib` with better colour schemes and the like. Bringing all these into the notebook and making them work in-line involves the following Python code: "

    "The first thing to note is that we've named the function `lattice_graph()`, which immediately contradicts what we said [above](#sec_concepts_networks_graphs) about referring to these structures as \"networks\". But `networkx` itself includes lots of functions for generating networks that follow this naming convention, so it seems sensible to be consistent with that even at the risk of confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build the lattice, we first create an empty network and populate it with nodes. We number the nodes in a predictable fashion so we can refer to them later. We then add edges. For all except the last column and row, we add an edge to the east and south neighbours of each node: a moment's though should convince you that this fleshes out most of the lattice. We then add edges to complete the lattice in the final right-hand column and bottom row, which costs respectively of only north-south and only east-west edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare this to the toy example from [above](#sec_concepts_networks_building), the only difference is that for the lattice we *calculated* the endpoints of each edge according to their indices, since there's a straightforward relationship between index and edge. This of course has the advantage that it works for lattices of arbitrary size, but is a technique that only works this weay for **regular** networks where there's some definite deterministic pattern to be captured. [Later](er-networks.ipynb) we'll see similar techniques applied to stochastic patterns, where the exact edges that are connected are selected randomly but nevertheless in a structured fashion that we can code in an algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing the lattice is perhaps a slightly more involved process than you might have expected, but we have to be careful that we add all the edges we want *and only those edges*. Spefifically, although all the non-edge nodes have links going in four directions, there's only one edge between each pair of nodes, and we have to be careful not to add too many. Notice how `networkx` manipulates the network. We give nodes unique indices (integers in this case) and then use these to identify the nodes at the ends of each edge we add.\n",
