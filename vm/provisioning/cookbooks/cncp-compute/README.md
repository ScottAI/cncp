# cncp-compute-cookbook

This cookbook provides a recipe that wraps all the cookbooks
required by the "Complex networks, complex processes" compute
VM. This sets up the libraries and tools needed to perform
network science simulations, without any graphical capabilities.

This VM is intended as a cluster or cloud worker node, not as
an interactive system. For that, see the "cncp-book" cookbook.


## Supported Platforms

Tested for Ubuntu, should work on any Linux.


## Attributes

None.


## Usage

Run the cncp-worker::default recipe to build the worker VM.
