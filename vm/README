Virtual machines and provisioning
=================================

This directory contains the code needed to create various virtual (and
real) machine installations that can be used to perform the
calculations described in "Complex networks, complex processes". The
idea is to provide a common, stable computational environment to
improve confidence and repeatability of simulations and other
calculations. To this end we adopt a "devops" approach that treats
computational infrastructure management as part of the source code
repository. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps for a discussion
of devops.)


Virtual and real machines
-------------------------

The directories in this hierarchy contain code to create and provision
various different virtual machines, and to provision a physical
machine:

book/		a Linux VM that can re-create the book itself
compute/	a compute VM suitable for running remote simulations
baremetal/	scripts to provision a physical machine as a compute node 

These machines are all guided by Python requirements files stored in
the repository and re-used to create the same computational
environment whenever the system is installed.

We use vagrant to control the creation and tear-down of virtual
machines, wrapped-up in Makefiles for simplicity. See
https://www.vagrantup.com/ for an explanation of vagrant.
 

Provisioning
------------

We use chef to provision machines for various purposes. A set of chef
recipes and resources describes the elements needed to install the
software in support of the main Python-based elements needed for the
book. See https://www.chef.io/chef/ for details of chef.
