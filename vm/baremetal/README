Installing a compute server onto bare metal
===========================================

By "bare metal" we mean running compute servers on a login to a real
machine. Actually the "real" machine may in fact be virtual, ut the
point is that it's a machine to which you have a login already, as
opposed to a virtual machine you're creating. (If you want to create a
VM from scratch, you need to use the code in the vm/compute
directory.)

The baremetal.sh script is intended to get the provisioning system up
and running, using the same set of chef recipes we use for VMs. To get
things working:

- Copy baremetal.sh to your home directory on the machine you want to
  provision
- Run the script using bash ./baremetal.sh

That should be it. The script will clone a minimal version of the git
repo containing only the provisioning code, and then use this to
populate a Python virtual environment and spin-up some compute
servers.
